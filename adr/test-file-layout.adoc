= Testing file layout

== Summary

=== Issue

Our project requires a standardised file layout for tests. This is necessary because there
are several tests, and they will become rather large due to the nature of the library.

The library prefers using proper classes in actual implementations and usages of it, however
this is not necessarily the case for testing, as they should be as self-contained as possible.

=== Decision

Use a single test per test class with the following structure:

.Structure
[source]
--
src/main/test/<package>
+ <test files>
+ placeholder/
  \ <placeholder resolvers and whatnot>
+ util/
  \ <util method classes and whatnot>
--

=== Status

Decided. We are open to new alternatives if necessary.
